# Pure Pursuit Lab

This package contains the solution for the Pure Pursuit lab of the F1/10 Autonomous Racing course at OSU. In order to build and function properly, the package requires that the particle filter package described in the F1/10 Manual as well as the skeleton code for the F1/10 simulator be sourced and locatable when catkin_make is run.
