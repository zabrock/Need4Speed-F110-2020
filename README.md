# Need4Speed-F110-2020

This repo is used by the team Need4Speed for submission of lab assignments as part of the F1/10 Autonomous Racing course at OSU.

Our weekly meeting time is on Wednesday at 10 AM.

The first week's submission requires the ROS serial package as installed via 
```
sudo apt-get install ros-<distro>-serial
```
where ```<distro>``` is replaced by the ROS distribution being used. The ```vesc``` and ```ackermann-msgs``` packages are also used, but come already installed in the workspace.
