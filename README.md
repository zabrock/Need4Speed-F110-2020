# Need4Speed-F110-2020

This repo is used by the team Need4Speed for submission of lab assignments as part of the F1/10 Autonomous Racing course at OSU.

Our weekly meeting time is on Wednesday at 10 AM.

As stated in lab, the first week's lab work is entirely individual, so no submission material relevant to the lab is included in this repo for the ROS lab.
